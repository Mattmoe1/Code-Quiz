The idea of this project was to create a quiz game where you hit the Start Quiz button and it takes you on a five part Q&A. You have seventy seconds to get through the quiz but everytime you get one question wrong it deducts fifteen seconds from the quiz. At the end you are prompted to enter your name so you can be placed onto the highscore page.

# Quiz-Game
As you proceed in your career as a web developer, you will probably be asked to complete a coding assessment, which is typically a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive challenges. Build a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## User Story

```

## Acceptance Criteria

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
